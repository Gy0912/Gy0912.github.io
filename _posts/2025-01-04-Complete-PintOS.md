PintOS is a small teaching operating system designed for educational purposes, and it is widely used in university operating systems courses to teach key OS concepts such as thread management, scheduling, virtual memory, and file systems, which is also four parts of the whole project.


I completed this project with my friend SenLee1, and the following table is the score we get.


|  Project  | Score(out of 100) | Offline testcases |   Due time   |
| :-------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :----------: |
| Project 1 |       95.25       |    All passed     | Nov.02, 2024 |
| Project 2 |       92.5        |    All passed     | Nov.16, 2024 |
| Project 3 |       91.7        |     2 failed      | Dec.07, 2024 |
| Project 4 |       88.44       |     2 failed      | Jan.04, 2025 |

Unfortunately, our source code was saved on the host and platform established by the school. At the end of the semester, due to negligence, we forgot to save it locally. After consulting the teacher, we confirmed that the code could not be recovered, so we could not provide the github repo. However, the course scores can still prove that we have indeed completed this project perfectly.
