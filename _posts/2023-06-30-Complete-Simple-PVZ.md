description: Brief report of completing the project.

This project is just a final for CS100, which is Introduction to Programming and I finished it using Cpp and CMake. In this project, I only need to write all parts in src and add a few file links in CMakeLists.


I got full score in this project although I left Pole Vaulting Zombie behind. It is a really nice project for those who begin learning Cpp. 


If you want to have a try, just search my repo called PVZ-program. Also you can click the github link at left lower part of the web. You will find it easily.


If you have any questions about this project, just leave your comments or contact me. I will reply soon.
