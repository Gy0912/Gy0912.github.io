### Motivation
I am a junior now, and I have thought that I should do sth in the field of research for a long time. So I joined Professor Zhihui Jiang's HCPS research group and started studying autonomous driving.
### Research Focus
Our group mainly focuses on building a perfect co-pilot based on a digital twin system. My main task is to build upon the existing CARLA model and attempt to implement a different perspective, shifting from a third-person view to a first-person view. At the same time, I aim to enable human control of the vehicle through external devices for driving.
