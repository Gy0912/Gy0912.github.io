After nearly half a semester of research in the lab, I realized that I have significant difficulties in balancing academics and research. My GPA is not particularly strong, and I still need to prioritize improving it. This semester, I completed OS and Compiler courses, but their projects consumed a considerable amount of my energy, leaving me with little time to focus on research, which resulted in no substantial output.


Moreover, in the second half of my junior year, I have planned to take an additional major course, meaning my schedule will be even busier than this semester. As a result, I decided to withdraw from the research group at the end of this semester and plan to resume research-related activities when my academic workload eases in my senior year.


Thanks to my Professor Jiang, he expressed understanding regarding my lack of commitment and my decision to withdraw.
