Our course comes from UCB CS188, and the whole project is divided into 2 parts: Pacman project and self training model project.


Pacman project is divided into 6 parts, in which the first project is divided into A part and B part. I finished those projects by myself.

Since this blog was actually edited in Feb.23, 2025, most infos like due time I have already forgotten. I apologize for that.


Self training model project is a group project and my teammate is SenLee. We choose to use an existing Python game implementation template, add agent model and train it. We want it can find a best way to get score.


Source code is public in my repo called simple-TankWar. We also wrote a simple paper to present our final results.


This project is scored by my AI teacher, but I have no access to know our score.
