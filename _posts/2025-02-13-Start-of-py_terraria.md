### Motivation
I love playing games, especially sandbox game like Terraria and Minecraft. So it occurs to me that why not try to implement one of them? And I start this personal project.

### Info
I choose Python since we have pygame, it will be easier if I use pygame. Source code will be public once I successfully make an alpha version, and I will continue to add contents, trying to have a perfect copy of terraria.
